# Microservices Example Project: Customer and Task Management

## Overview

This project demonstrates a microservices architecture with two main services: `ms-customer` and `ms-task`. Each service is responsible for distinct functionalities and communicates with each other to provide a comprehensive system for managing customer data and tasks.

## Services Description

### ms-customer Service

**Purpose**: Manages customer data, including user registration and authentication.

**Key Features**:
- **User Registration**: Allows new users to sign up and store their information.
- **User Authentication**: Manages user login and secure token generation.
- **Data Sharing**: Communicates with `ms-task` to provide necessary customer information.
- **API Endpoints**: Exposes endpoints for user registration, authentication, and data retrieval.

### ms-task Service

**Purpose**: Manages tasks that are created by or assigned to customers.

**Key Features**:
- **Task Creation**: Enables users to create and manage tasks.
- **Task Assignment**: Allows for tasks to be assigned to specific customers.
- **Task Querying**: Supports querying tasks by various criteria.
- **Integration**: Integrates with `ms-customer` for linking tasks with customer profiles.
- **API Endpoints**: Provides endpoints for managing tasks.

## Inter-Service Communication

- **Asynchronous Messaging**: Utilizes message brokers like RabbitMQ or Kafka for event-driven communication.
- **RESTful API Calls**: Employs direct API calls for synchronous communication and data retrieval.

## Data Storage

- Implements the database-per-service pattern, with separate databases for each microservice.

## Additional Components

- **API Gateway**: Serves as the single entry point for the microservices.
- **Service Discovery**: Utilizes tools like Eureka for dynamic service discovery.
- **Circuit Breaker**: Implements Hystrix or Resilience4j for enhanced system resilience.

## Security

- Enforces secure communication and implements OAuth2.0 or OpenID Connect for user authentication and authorization.

## Deployment

- Services are containerized using Docker and managed using Kubernetes for scalable deployments.

## Monitoring and Logging

- Centralized logging and monitoring are set up for maintaining service health and performance insights.

## Getting Started
