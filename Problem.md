# Problem: Task Manager API

Design and implement a RESTful API for a task manager. 
The API should allow users to perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) 
operations on tasks. Each task should have the following attributes:

``
Task ID
Task Title
Task Description
Due Date
Status (e.g., Pending, In Progress, Completed)
Your API should support the following endpoints:
``

Create a Task: Allow users to create a new task by providing the task title, task description, due date, and initial status.

Retrieve Tasks: Provide an endpoint to retrieve a list of all tasks. Users should also be able to retrieve a specific task by its ID.

Update a Task: Allow users to update an existing task by providing its ID. They should be able to update the task title, task description, due date, and status.

Delete a Task: Allow users to delete a task by providing its ID.

This problem will give you the opportunity to work with HTTP methods 
(POST, GET, PUT, DELETE), handle request and response formats (typically JSON), 
and design a simple database model for tasks. You can choose the programming language 
and framework that you're most comfortable with or want to learn.
